# Mapping_Earthquakes

Earthquakes are events that, quite literally, shake the earth and our foundations of live. In some ways trying to code them can do the same. With the challenges that coding can bring, ones world can be personally rocked by the difficulty presented. However, through the aid of modules, stack overflow, classmates, and ones own grit and determination a solution can be found. Earthquakes were mapped out in relation to tectonic plates on planet earth and are marked with circle markers of varying colors, line paths of major fault lines, and the options to show earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic lines.

The most difficult issues with this project came simply from getting the maps to appear. Most of the issues were CORS activation errors. Once this was surmassed, the biggest issue then became simple formatting and deciding what colors to use. While most color choices were obvious, and most formatting choices were lined out and shown in the module, walking through something and doing it are two entirely different beasts. Once conquered, the maps were shown and the markers were bright!
